<p>Hi, I'm Alex Rajewski, a botanist turned cancer bioinformatician. I currently work at Tempus AI figuring out computational biology questions in precision oncology. Before that I spent a while as a bioinformatician at the Cedar-Sinai Medical Center Cancer Genomics Core working on [several](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.954929) excellent [research](https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00287.2022) projects with faculty there. In 2020 I completed my PhD in plant genetics at UC Riverside where I [transformed, assembled, and annotated]({{ site.baseurl }}/Datura/) the 2 Gbp genome of *Datura stramonium*.  In 2015 I obtained my MS in horticulture and population genetics at the University of Georgia [working](({{ site.baseurl }}/Rivercane/)) on the clonal, American bamboo Rivercane. When not buried in botany or lines of code, I'm usually buried in a sci-fi novel or a very very dark beer.</p>
