description: "Genome Assembly for Jimsonweed (Datura stramonium)"
---

Jimsonweed (_Datura stramonium_) is a weedy plant in the nightshade family notable for its production of many useful medicinal or insecticidal compounds like the tropane alkaloids [hyoscyamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyoscyamine) and [atropine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atropine). The plant was also historically used as a model organism to answer questions regarding aneuploidy and polyplody, and the [first haploid flowering plant reported](http://www.doi.org/10.1126/science.55.1433.646) was _D. stramonium_.

[Previously](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002%2Faps3.1220) I developed a technique for stable transgenic transformation of _D. stramonium_ by inserting a copy of the _GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN_ gene and tracking its inheritance. This was the first report of stable transgene inheritance in _Datura_ and was an important step toward targeted engineering of the tropane alkaloid synthesis pathway. Stable transformation is also necessary for the application of CRISPR/Cas9 mutatgenesis as well. The technique is based on [tissue culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant_tissue_culture), which can have a number of negative side effects on plant growth.

In order the characterize the impacts of tissue culture on the genome of _D. stramonium_, I sequenced, assembled, and annotated a draft genome of our plant prior to tissue culture. I did this with guidance from [Amy Litt](https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/amylitt) and [Jason Stajich](http://lab.stajich.org/home/welcome/), using a combination of Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing technologies. We then [published](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-021-07489-2) a comparison of compared several plants that had undergone our transformation procedure to our reference genome plant using RNA-seq, to characterize differential gene expression, and genome resequencing, to characterize mutation rate. We found very [few differentially expressed genes](https://github.com/rajewski/Datura-Genome/blob/master/Manuscript/SupplmentalData_DEGs.csv) following tissue culture and a [high number](https://github.com/rajewski/Datura-Genome/blob/master/Manuscript/Mutation_Summary.png) of (mostly non-coding) mutations. Examining our genome annotation, we found a large number of predicted genes, but we expect that this is an overestimate based on a number of analyses. We also found [gene duplications](https://github.com/rajewski/Datura-Genome/blob/master/Manuscript/Trees.png) in the first commited step of tropane alkaloid synthesis, tropinone reductase I, as well as the final step that produced scopolamine, hyoscyamine 6 &beta;-hydroxylase.

Interstingly, the fruits of plants in the genus _Datura_ are dry, dehiscent capsules, superfically similar to that of tobacco. However, _Datura_ is actually more closely related to plants that produce a fleshy berry, such as tomato, instead of a dry capsule. This means that in terms of fruit type, _Datura_ has undergone an evolutionary reversal, and this reversal presents an interesting opportunity to further understand the genetic basis of fruit evolution by comparing the dry fruit of _Datura_ with the dry (but distantly related) fruit of tobacco and the closely related (but fleshy) fruit of tomato. In the future, the transformation technique and the draft genome can be used for more detailed studies of fruit type evolution, as well as, engineering the tropane alkaloid synthesis pathway.
