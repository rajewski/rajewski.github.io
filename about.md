<p>Hi, I'm Alex Rajewski, a botanist turned cancer bioinformatician. I currently work at Tempus AI figuring out computational biology questions in precision oncology, but I also spent a while as a bioinformatician at the Cedar's Sinai Cancer Genomics Core working on several excellent research projects with faculty there. I got my PhD in plant genetics at UC Riverside, and my MS in horticulture and population genetics at the University of Georgia. When not buried in botany or lines of code, I'm usually buried in a sci-fi novel or a very very dark beer.</p>
