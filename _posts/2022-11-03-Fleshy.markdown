Throughout the evolution of flowering plants (angiosperms) there have been many evolutionary transitions from an ancestral dry fruit to a more derived fleshy fruit. My dissertation research examined the genetic mechanisms behind this economically and ecologically important trait in the nightshade family of plants (Solanaceae).

In nightshades, early-diverging species like tobacco or petunia generally have a dry, dehiscent, capsular fruit, while later-diverging species like tomato or pepper have an edible, fleshy berry. Along with another grad student in [Amy Litt's](<(https://profiles.ucr.edu/app/home/profile/amylitt)>){:target="_blank"} lab at UCR, we investigated the developmental and evolutionary basis of dry vs fleshy fruits. My research specifically focused on the dry-fruited species desert tobacco (<em>Nicotiana obtusifolia</em>), but I extended the focus of this work into wild tomato (\_Solanum pimpinellifolium_), _Arabidopsis thaliana_, and melon (_Cucumis melo_).

We found a "core" set of orthologous genes among the five species and examined patterns of gene expression in this core set among the species. These results were [published](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.954929){:target="\_blank"} in Frontiers in Plant Science in 2022
